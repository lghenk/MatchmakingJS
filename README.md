# MatchmakingJS
A matchmaking system written in NodeJS for my personal development and it also doubles as a school assignment 

## Features
- Da

## Software Analysis 
I decided to go with NodeJS because of its scalability and the fact that it can run on multiple platforms.
Also because of its Non-Blocking IO operations makes this quite desirable for large scale applications

## Goals of this project
- Have a fully functional matchmaking system
- Get more experience with NodeJS and networking programming
- Learn Redis
- Write a very nice portfolio piece that I can possibly use for future projects
- Optional but preferable: Learn how to unit test

### Step 1
For Step 1 I want a successful network connection with storage of the currently waiting for a match players

### Step 2
I want that the matchmaking can keep track of parties and do some basic matchmaking

### Step 3
I want a more advanced matchmaking algorithm and the start of a server spawner communication bridge
